# Project outline

- This is a simple project made with javafx scene builder tool, I tought it might be helpful to get the hang of at least one GUI tool during my college, so I learned how to use the tool during my first winter holiday in the college

- I initially wrote the project with IntelliJ, but now I have changed into using vscode most of the time, still there won't be any problems running the program on your computer as long as you have maven on your computer

- to start the project, you need to compile all the files at first, then excute the file named `server` in the folder `/src/../net/server/`, I create the project using socket , so inorder to have the other player entering the game, another player should execute the file named `client`  in the folder `/src/../net/client/`, then enter the IPv4 address of the host player
